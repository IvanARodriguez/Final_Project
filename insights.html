                        <p class="">TASKIT is a web application that allows the user to create, manage and delete tasks, this application accepts 
                            several data entries such as assigned to, roles, due date and more, this application was designed to have a desktop application feel,
                            however the developers desired to implement mobile first developments approaches, this way the web application work effectively on any 
                            device screen size.
                        </p>

                        <h3 class="fw-light">The Design</h3>

                        <p>In the beginning, the application had an ocean blue and orange color palette design, but the design looked outdated and wasn't using the 
                           best design practices, therefore the developers desired to implement a <i>minimalist and modern</i> design with a dark theme look where dark 
                           gray and orange are the main colors.
                        </p>
                        
                        <div class="row mt-3">

                            <div class="col-md-6">
                                <h4 class="bg-orange text-dark ps-3 py-2 mt-3">The form</h4>
        
                                <p>One of the core features of this web app is the form, the entries allow the user to provide the details needed for a single task, this 
                                   simple but effective form has a suitable datepicker which stands out, due to the uncommon appearance, the date picker looks more like a gadget 
                                   than a form input. Also, the required fields have a red asterisk which indicates that the fields are required for a better user experience.
                                </p>
                            </div>

                            <div class="col-md-6">
                                <h4 class="bg-orange text-dark ps-3 py-2 mt-3">The Tasks</h4>
    
                                <p>The task section dynamically renders all tasks, the design is minimalist, with just the task status indicator, task number, and task name giving the 
                                    user more clarity and the ability to focus on what matters most! The handling of each task is also important, that 
                                    is why there is a call to action button to show more details and actions to be taken such as mark as done,delete, and priority.
                                </p>
                            </div>

                        <h2 class="display-4">Features</h2>

                        <p>There are some features that provide a richer user interaction, one is the implementation of a splash screen for mobile screen sizes, TaskIT also 
                            includes:
